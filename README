How do you run it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run it in two ways.
 1. You can checkout the entire source code and run this command from the checked out root directory
    mvn clean install exec:java
    (NOTE: You need to have JDK and MAVEN installed in order to use this)
 2. You can just download the binary https://github.com/perusworld/yosanai-aws-console-swing/blob/master/binary/yosanai-aws-console-swing-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar and run this command from the checked out root directory
    java -jar yosanai-aws-console-swing-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    (NOTE: you need to have atleast JRE installed in order to use this)

NOTE: Right now the AWS Key and Secret Key asked during config is store in a plain text file at {USER_HOME}/.yosanai-aws-config
