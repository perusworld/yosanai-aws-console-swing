How do you run it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run it in two ways.

    mvn clean install exec:java
    (NOTE: You need to have JDK and MAVEN installed in order to use this)
 2. You can just download the binaries https://github.com/perusworld/yosanai-aws-console-swing/blob/master/binary/ and run this command from the checked out root directory
    java -jar yosanai-aws-console-swing-1.0.jar
    (NOTE: you need to have atleast JRE installed in order to use this)

Password
~~~~~~~~
The Yosanai - Amazon Web Services Swing Console stores the application configurations in a file with encrypted values. So when you launch the application for the first tiem it would ask you for a password based on which the configuration will encrypted and stored. You would need to provide this password every time you start application or modify the configurations.

   NOTE: This uses http://www.bouncycastle.org/ encryption libraries and also requires Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html#other) to be installed
